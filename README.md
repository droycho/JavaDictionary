#### By _**DJ Roychoudhury**_

## Description

_This is a very simple and basic Java web program designed to demonstrate understanding of Java development using Objects in Objects. This application is meant to create a list of words that the user can enter into the page. As the user add more words, it will create a list of words, or objects. Eash of these words, or objects, will have one or more definition. These definitions will be objects withing the word objects, so the user can add as many definitions as they want to each word._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository to your desktop, or desired directory.
* Open your terminal/command line and navigate to the directory that the clone was saved in(desktop or what ever directory you chose).
* Once you are in the parent directory (should be JavaDictionary), enter `$ gradle run`.
* Once gradle runs from the terminal/command line, open a new tab/window in your desired web browser.
* Enter the following in address bar: localhost:4567
* Try it out!
* You will need to either navigate back to localhost:4567 to create a new list, or use the back button and refresh.
